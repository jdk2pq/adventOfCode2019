As of Day 17th, I still don't have part 2 working. And part 1 took some considerable effort. I didn't realize at first that _angles_ and _geometry_ were the key to figuring out which asteroids could be hit. I thought it was all about the slope and path (e.g. up 2, over 1 first and then up 4, over 2 cannot be hit). Reading over comments on the subreddit helped me in figuring out what I needed to do instead.
