# Day 12

    yarn ts-node part1.ts

# Part 2

    yarn ts-node part2.ts
    
As of Day 17, I still don't have Part 2 solved.

I didn't find Part 1 too challenging. After fixing a couple of bugs in the math, things worked! For Part 2, I'll have to find a more optimal way of running my code, since it seems like this could run forever.
