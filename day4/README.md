# Day 4

# Part 1

    yarn ts-node part1.ts

# Part 2

    yarn ts-node part2.ts
    
Solved both of these problems in under 15 minutes total (and my solution for part1 worked the first time I ran it! part2...not quite, but I still got it running quickly), which was uplifting after spending a few hours on day3 and hitting many issues.
