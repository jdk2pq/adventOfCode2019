This one was fun. It took a little bit to figure out the robot moving/print algorithm, and a slight modification to my `Intcode` program to run a function when there was output, but once that was done, it was fairly easy and enjoyable.

For Part 2, I was able to get the license plate to print in a legible enough way, but mirrored. Whoops. Oh well.
