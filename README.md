# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2019 :christmas_tree:

A repo for my solutions to the 2019 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I'm using TypeScript.

## What is Advent of Code?

From the [website](https://adventofcode.com): 

    "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
    for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in
    any programming language you like. People use them as a speed
    contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework,
    practice problems, or to challenge each other."
    
I'm in a friendly competition for this year with some of my co-workers at [CCRi](https://www.ccri.com).

## Running my solutions

I used `ts-node` for a REPL and also to execute the TypeScript files, usually `console.log()`'ing the answers. To do the same, run:

    git clone https://github.com/jdk2pq/adventOfCode2019.git
    cd adventOfCode2019
    yarn
    cd {dayYouWantToRun}
    yarn ts-node {partYouWantToRun}.ts
    
Each day also has a `README` in the directory with commands to run the code.
    
## If my solutions are awful...

...teach me how to do things better! :smiley: I welcome any and all feedback/criticism/critiques/helpful notes/anything really!

The code in this repo is **_not cleaned up_** at all, nor **_attempting to be the most efficient as possible_**. It's just me trying to quickly code up a solution to get to the correct answer, since the amount of points I get on the leaderboard corresponds with how quickly I answer the problem.

Also, to co-workers, friends, family, recruiters?: **_this is not an accurate representation of how my code at my job looks._** It's actually much better than my code at work. (just kidding :laughing:)

Really, just feel free to use and remix as you want. I don't need credit, but it'd be awesome if you gave it!
