Woo! Intcode computer is done! I completed this relatively quickly after looking on the subreddit for other people hitting the seemingly infamous `[203, 0]` error. At least I'm not alone!
 
 For some reason, I still can't get the Part 1, test 1 working, but I was able to get the right answers for Part 1 and Part 2...so hopefully that doesn't hurt me later on.
